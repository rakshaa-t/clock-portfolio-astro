      {type:"text",html:`<p>The whole thing started with me looking at the iPhone clock app on a random Tuesday. Beautiful interface. I'd never seen a webpage with circular navigation like a clock. So naturally I had to fiddle with the idea.</p>`},
      {type:"text",html:`<p>The initial idea was actually the entire webpage as a clock component. Rotate through sections, everything lives inside the clock face. Looked cool but the UX was genuinely bad. So the clock became a preview and navigation system instead. You can hop between sections or glance at primary content in each category right from the clock face.</p>`},

      {type:"text",html:`<p>Once the clock was the muse, the next step was looking at familiar objects. Kindle, Notes app, <a class="note-link" href="https://mymind.com" target="_blank">Mymind</a>. These products are already widely used. People more or less know their UX. No need to reinvent the wheel. So they're built into my personal website as they are, or as close as possible. The navigation is rotation but the experience feels linear.</p>`},

Keeping that as integral part of my design I drafted my facets alongside my design explorations:</p>`},
      {type:"text",html:`<p><em>Discoverability</em> / Users can discover more about me but only if they wish to. Want to see what I think about a book I read? Glance through my Kindle highlights. Share my notes on X? Visit my bookmarks? Copy the links to your clipboard? All available but nothing shown by default. Every section has its own navigation. Only what's necessary is on screen, and if the viewer's curiosity persists they can go deeper.</p>`},
      {type:"text",html:`<p><em>Nostalgia</em> / Each section connects to something the viewer already knows. A Kindle, a notes app, <a class="note-link" href="https://mymind.com" target="_blank">Mymind</a>. My approach might be a bit biased towards iOS users but the interfaces are easy to pick up even if not familiar. I also added sound to interactions. Rotating the clock, clicking through notes, shuffling the stack cards. Each one has its own sound. That part took me a while to get right honestly.</p>`},
      {type:"text",html:`<p><em>Compartmentalisation</em> / The website works in compartments (the clock quadrants) and each one gives its own experience. Each compartment holds the power to expand as more of my data comes. Maybe someday the Kindle becomes a full reading experience, or the bookmarks board becomes an extension of my entire <a class="note-link" href="https://mymind.com" target="_blank">Mymind</a>. That kind of expansion may never be needed but the architecture allows for it.</p>`},
      {type:"text",html:`<p><em>Continuous refinement</em> / This website is how I work. You can see in real time what I'm drawing inspiration from, what I'm reading, what I'm writing about, what designs I'm experimenting with. A living space.</p>`},
      {type:"image",src:"/article/about-section.jpg",caption:"The about section"},
      {type:"text",html:`<p><strong>The build</strong></p>`},
      {type:"text",html:`<p>All started with a rough sketch and Claude Code's CLI. Instead of building the whole website at once the build process was compartmentalised too. Clock component first. Get that working, get the rotation feeling right, get the hand snapping to sections. Once that felt solid, objectify the rest of the content one section at a time. Clock, then Kindle, then Notes, then <a class="note-link" href="https://mymind.com" target="_blank">Mymind</a>. Each one its own mini project within the project.</p>`},
      {type:"image",src:"/article/mymind-cards.jpg",caption:"Compartmentalised build: each section in isolation"},
      {type:"text",html:`<p>Quick prototypes in vanilla HTML first, to see if the interaction patterns actually worked, then Astro as the build framework. The design keeps things simple on the framework side. Static pages with JS doing the heavy lifting. Astro was the right fit.</p>`},
      {type:"text",html:`<p>Sounds use the Web Audio API. Took a bit of back and forth to find the right tone for each interaction. Everything is synthesised in real-time through code so each sound responds to exactly how you interact with it. That was a fun rabbit hole.</p>`},
      {type:"text",html:`<p>The whole stack is vanilla JS and one CSS file. These components took about three weeks and close to 100 iterations.</p>`},

    preview:"All design is communication. Code just gave it more dimensions...",
    body:`<p>With the canvas the permutations of what you could do with a rectangle, ellipse or polygon felt endless. All that freedom. But ultimately all design is communication. If you communicate through visual shapes long enough you naturally develop taste.</p><p>I think code is also a form of communication. It just never got seen that way because of the technical barrier around it.</p><p>Canvas restricts you to a one dimensional output. With code you see design in a multi dimensional form. I don't just see a rectangle anymore, I see a plane. A plane on which I can add sound, depth, interaction, math and physics. Code in itself is a system. I like to call design with code systems design because that's what's happening. You're building systems and articulating ideas into words at the same time. It stimulates a lot of your expressive mechanisms all at once.</p><p>This doesn't mean the canvas is going anywhere. For people who truly love it their craft will only deepen. The canvas has existed for centuries and it will continue to exist for the creatives. All the noise around AI and code doesn't change someone's method of expression. If it's the canvas, staying true to it is a moat.</p><p>Code and canvas are closer than they appear. It's not duality as an output. It's duality as an input. A child who likes math may not like chemistry. Both are sciences of their own sort. The output is a good user experience but the input depends on what the creator has leverage in. Interest, passion, love. Different inputs don't mean the outputs should differ.</p><p>I'm not here to say which is superior. Canvas will always exist. Code just gave wings to people who were multi dimensional in their thought process and ideas.</p>`
