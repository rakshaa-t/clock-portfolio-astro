The problem was straightforward: too many clicks, too many tabs, no idea what\'s going on at a glance. My job was to take a messy multi-source process and turn it into something that feels calm, navigable and sharp for people juggling around ten deals at once.','The redesigned dashboard surfaces active deals, ongoing tasks, recent changes and AI suggestions all in one view. Built an AI-powered smart search for quickly finding anything across deals. The deal overview page was redesigned with a visual hierarchy that actually makes sense when you\'re scanning fast.','On the system side I built components for deal notes, updates, tasks, document trails and team mentions. The interface had to respect mental load. No visual clutter, no over-design. Everything scalable across the different functional areas the teams work in.','Delivered comprehensive specs covering states, empty flows, placeholder logic, permissions, microcopy and layout rules for handoff. Both light and dark theme versions. The kind of documentation where devs don\'t have to come back and ask what happens when something is empty or who can see what.'],slides:['#8BA8C4','#7B98B4','#6B88A4','#7B98B4']},
