  {title:'Ova App',tags:['Health','0-1','Figma','Rive'],link:'#',desc:['A privacy-first period tracking app for women of all ages. The core idea was a companion character called Ova who guides users through their cycles, gives them insights and predicts upcoming symptoms and moods. Not just another tracker but a warm buddy throughout the reproductive journey. I handled product strategy, vision, UX and UI design.','Hannah came to me clear about what she wanted: a privacy-first, teenage friendly period tracking app. Her frustration came from competitors that make period tracking explicit and unfriendly for younger users and also share their data. She has a few consumer apps on Base and wanted to bring this under her parent company Cryptiq. I connected with her vision immediately and we started the same day.','I dug into the competitor landscape. Looked at Flo and others. A few things became clear quickly. We needed something that felt less analytical and more warm. We needed an educational layer because not every woman knows what luteal phase or ovulation is. Users had to know their data is encrypted. And a companion resonated the most because that seemed slightly missing from the market. AI companions are on a rise and it made sense to hop onto that wave.','Explored two design directions. Digital Confection: bright, colorful, approachable, sweet, new school, feminine. Fun, slightly gamified, light hearted. Not just cycles but symptoms, cravings, the whole picture. This would align with the younger demographic.\n\nWarm Constructivism: warm, grown up, sophisticated, subtle, grounded. Bold and expressive, mature but full of energy. Tactile, confident, a little sensual. The palette pulls from natural tones like clay, skin and peach.','Digital Confection won. The idea that we wanted to cater to a bigger demographic and not just grown ups steered that decision.\n\nFor the companion we wanted something not too complicated. Something cute and relatable. The finalized characters were based off the resemblance of an egg (OVA) which is the main biological element. Minimal, youthful and curious. During onboarding users pick their Ova, give it a unique color, name and character. That personalisation was important for emotional connection.','The Oracle dashboard shows current cycle status, lets users log symptoms and periods which helps predict future cycles. Ova Chat is a companion you can talk to for personalized recommendations on the paid plan, with voice enabled chat.\n\nOnboarding asks basic questions about hormonal health, birth control and goals to align the app to specific needs. Beta releases on Base first, then iOS and Android after early feedback.'],slides:['#6C7EB8','#5C6EA8','#4C5E98','#5C6EA8','#6C7EB8','#4C5E98']},
  {title:'Greex DeFi',tags:['Fintech','Trading','2024'],link:'#',desc:['Greex was a decentralized options and futures trading platform. The idea was to make strategy-based trading more accessible. Users could apply predefined strategies, understand risk-reward visually, and execute trades across web and mobile. I led the complete product design for both platforms, from wireframing and UX architecture to polished UI.','The hardest part was designing for a space I had zero experience in. Options and futures trading has a steep learning curve even for users, let alone designers. So before I touched any UX I spent time understanding trading logic, strategies, risk curves and market mechanics. That groundwork changed everything about how I approached the screens.','The UX flow I landed on let users browse and apply prebuilt trading strategies, see the strategy logic and risk profile visually, place trades through a simplified execution UI, and track everything in real time through a portfolio dashboard. The whole thing had to feel instant because traders don\'t wait.','The strategic decision that made this work was educating users while letting them act. The flow didn\'t just look clean, it actively supported decision-making. Every screen was designed to remove hesitation and guide action.\n\nThe platform was designed and tested with strong feedback during early demos. The company shut down due to investor issues but the product foundation remains a complete deep-dive into a complex domain translated into a clean experience. One of my proudest projects honestly.'],slides:['#9DB8D0','#8DA8C0','#7D98B0','#8DA8C0']},

  {title:'DealDoc',tags:['SaaS','Dashboard','2025'],link:'#',desc:['DealDoc is a workspace for investment teams. The problem was straightforward: too many clicks, too many tabs, no idea what\'s going on at a glance. My job was to take a messy multi-source process and turn it into something that feels calm, navigable and sharp for people juggling around ten deals at once.','The redesigned dashboard surfaces active deals, ongoing tasks, recent changes and AI suggestions all in one view. Built an AI-powered smart search for quickly finding anything across deals. The deal overview page was redesigned with a visual hierarchy that actually makes sense when you\'re scanning fast.','On the system side I built components for deal notes, updates, tasks, document trails and team mentions. The interface had to respect mental load. No visual clutter, no over-design. Everything scalable across the different functional areas the teams work in.','Delivered comprehensive specs covering states, empty flows, placeholder logic, permissions, microcopy and layout rules for handoff. Both light and dark theme versions. The kind of documentation where devs don\'t have to come back and ask what happens when something is empty or who can see what.'],slides:['#8BA8C4','#7B98B4','#6B88A4','#7B98B4']},
