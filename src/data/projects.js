  {title:'Greex DeFi',tags:['Fintech','Trading','2024'],link:'#',desc:['Greex was a decentralized options and futures trading platform. The idea was to make strategy-based trading more accessible. Users could apply predefined strategies, understand risk-reward visually, and execute trades across web and mobile. I led the complete product design for both platforms, from wireframing and UX architecture to polished UI.','The hardest part was designing for a space I had zero experience in. Options and futures trading has a steep learning curve even for users, let alone designers. So before I touched any UX I spent time understanding trading logic, strategies, risk curves and market mechanics. That groundwork changed everything about how I approached the screens.','The UX flow I landed on let users browse and apply prebuilt trading strategies, see the strategy logic and risk profile visually, place trades through a simplified execution UI, and track everything in real time through a portfolio dashboard. The whole thing had to feel instant because traders don\'t wait.','The strategic decision that made this work was educating users while letting them act. The flow didn\'t just look clean, it actively supported decision-making. Every screen was designed to remove hesitation and guide action.\n\nThe platform was designed and tested with strong feedback during early demos. The company shut down due to investor issues but the product foundation remains a complete deep-dive into a complex domain translated into a clean experience. One of my proudest projects honestly.'],slides:['#9DB8D0','#8DA8C0','#7D98B0','#8DA8C0']},

  {title:'DealDoc',tags:['SaaS','Dashboard','2025'],link:'#',desc:['DealDoc is a workspace for investment teams. The problem was straightforward: too many clicks, too many tabs, no idea what\'s going on at a glance. My job was to take a messy multi-source process and turn it into something that feels calm, navigable and sharp for people juggling around ten deals at once.','The redesigned dashboard surfaces active deals, ongoing tasks, recent changes and AI suggestions all in one view. Built an AI-powered smart search for quickly finding anything across deals. The deal overview page was redesigned with a visual hierarchy that actually makes sense when you\'re scanning fast.','On the system side I built components for deal notes, updates, tasks, document trails and team mentions. The interface had to respect mental load. No visual clutter, no over-design. Everything scalable across the different functional areas the teams work in.','Delivered comprehensive specs covering states, empty flows, placeholder logic, permissions, microcopy and layout rules for handoff. Both light and dark theme versions. The kind of documentation where devs don\'t have to come back and ask what happens when something is empty or who can see what.'],slides:['#8BA8C4','#7B98B4','#6B88A4','#7B98B4']},
